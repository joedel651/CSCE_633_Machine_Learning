General Instructions:

1. Do not use any additional libraries. Your code will be tested in a pre-built environment with only 
the library above available.

2. You are expected to fill in the skeleton code precisely as per provided. On top of skeleton code given,
you may write whatever deemed necessary to complete the assignment. For example, you may define additional 
default arguments, class parameters, or methods to help you complete the assignment.

3. Some initial steps or definition are given, aiming to help you getting started. As long as you follow 
the argument and return type, you are free to change them as you see fit.

4. Your code should be free of compilation errors. Compilation errors will result in 0 marks.
